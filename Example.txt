////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Observation: Here, the first input text is considered as standard and hence corresponding message digest is obtained.
The second and third strings have a character modified in it. For second string, a fullstop is added and for third input, third character of string is changed to upper case.
It is observed that adding a single character or modifying a character changes the digest completely. The digest is well garbled and no co-relation between input and output can be found.
